# Test Report Template

This is a ready-to-use template for test reports in a standardized format that should be respected by all Delta Lab projects. It is based on ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119, IEC 60068, ISO/IEC 17025.

To use the template just directly modify `test_report.tex` for your particular test case. You do not need to modify any other template files.
